we utilize a novel quantile filtering algorithm, a Radial Basis Function and Multi-layer Perceptron Neural network
Quantile filtering is based on quantiles set on a normal distribution of data that specifies the location of dataset regarded as clean and the region of dataset regarded as outliers.
we also propose an automatic method of fault detection based on the conversion the distance between points in the 2 dimension space into a confidence interval of a clean data......read more on this from the paper
